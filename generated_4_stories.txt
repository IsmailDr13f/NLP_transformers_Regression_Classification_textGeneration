STORY: "The Night of the Living Dead" - "I'm going to kill myself."


The night of the living dead was one of the most memorable moments I've ever had. The night of the living dead, the night that I was supposed to be dead. It was a night that I was supposed to be dead, and I was supposed to be alive. I didn't know what to do, and the only thing I knew that I could do was to go home. I didn't know how, I just didn't know how to live. I didn't know how to live. I didn't know how I was going to survive, I just didn't know how to live.


I woke up the next morning, and I was in my bed. I was lying on my side, looking at the clock, wondering what I had to do to get back to sleep. I was going to die, and I didn't know if I would be able to get up to go to sleep, or if I would die alone, and I couldn't even get to sleep. I was in a terrible dream, and I was going to be dead. I was not going to die alone, and I was not going to die alone with my life on the line. I was not going to be alone, and I was not going to die alone with my life on the line.<|endoftext|>
